## **Predicting Mortality of Heart Failure Patients**
**Overview**
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict mortality in heart failure patients based on clinical health data. The goal is to build a predictive model that identifies high-risk patients and supports data-driven medical decision making.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset contains medical attributes of heart failure patients, including:
Age
Anaemia
Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK)
Diabetes
Ejection Fraction
High Blood Pressure
Platelets
Serum Creatinine
Serum Sodium
Sex
Smoking
Time (Follow-up period)
DEATH_EVENT (Target Variable)
The target variable indicates whether the patient died during the follow-up period.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow / Keras (for ANN)

**Project Workflow**
Data Loading
Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Scaling
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Performance Comparison

**Machine Learning Models Used**
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix

**Project Objective**
To develop an accurate and reliable machine learning model for predicting mortality risk in heart failure patients using structured clinical data.
