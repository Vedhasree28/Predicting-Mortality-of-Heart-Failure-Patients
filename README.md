# **Predicting Mortality of Heart Failure Patients Using Machine Learning**
## **Project Overview**
* Designed and implemented a machine learning solution to predict mortality risk in heart failure patients using clinical health data.
* Built classification models to identify high-risk patients and support data-driven healthcare decisions.
* Compared traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques for predictive performance.

## **Objective**
* Analyze clinical features influencing patient survival.
* Develop accurate classification models for mortality prediction.
* Evaluate and compare model performance using standard metrics.

## **Dataset Description**
Clinical dataset containing medical records of heart failure patients.
Key features include:
* Age
* Anaemia
* Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK)
* Diabetes
* Ejection Fraction
* High Blood Pressure
* Platelets
* Serum Creatinine
* Serum Sodium
* Sex
* Smoking
* Time (Follow-up duration)
DEATH_EVENT (Target Variable: 0 = Survived, 1 = Died)

## **Technologies Used**
